# Smart Traffic Management System

## Overview

This project simulates a Smart Traffic Management System implemented in Java. The system optimizes traffic flow by controlling traffic signals at different intersections, aiming to reduce congestion and improve efficiency on the road.

## Features

- **Traffic Signal Optimization:** Controls traffic signals at intersections to optimize traffic flow.
- **Traffic Signal States:** Manages traffic signal states including green, yellow, and red for effective traffic management.
- **Real-Time Optimization:** Utilizes real-time traffic data and optimization algorithms to dynamically adjust traffic signal timings.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/yourusername/smart-traffic-management-system.git>
    
    ```
    
2. **Compile and Run:**
    
    ```bash
    cd smart-traffic-management-system
    javac SmartTrafficManagementSystem.java
    java SmartTrafficManagementSystem
    
    ```
    
3. **Optimize Traffic Flow:**
    
    The system will simulate traffic flow optimization and display the current traffic signal states.
    

## Usage

1. **Optimize Traffic Flow:**
    
    The system automatically optimizes traffic flow by controlling traffic signals based on predefined algorithms.
    
2. **View Traffic Signal States:**
    
    Check the current traffic signal states at different intersections displayed by the system.
